### Workflow Description

1. The operator starts the system from the HMI.
2. The conveyor transports bottles toward the filling station.
3. A sensor detects the bottle and positions it accurately for filling.
4. The filling valve opens and dispenses liquid until the preset filling level is reached.
5. During filling, the PLC checks for a **Leak Bottle Fault**.
6. If a leak is detected, an alarm is generated, and the bottle continues to the **Combined Sorting and Reject Station**, where it is rejected by the puller mechanism.
7. If no leak is detected, the bottle proceeds to the capping station.
8. The capping cylinder places the cap onto the bottle.
9. The bottle is transported to the **Combined Sorting and Reject Station**.
10. At the **Combined Sorting and Reject Station**, cap presence is verified before the bottle is accepted or rejected.
11. Bottles that pass all quality checks continue toward the finished product area.
12. Bottles with missing caps are rejected by the puller mechanism.
13. Production statistics, machine runtime, reject count updates after every cycle and bottles-per-hour are automatically updated on the HMI every minute.
14. The PLC repeats the sequence until the operator stops the system or an emergency/fault condition occurs.

## 🚨 Fault Handling

The PLC continuously monitors the system for abnormal operating conditions. Whenever a fault is detected, the appropriate alarm is displayed on the HMI, the affected process is handled according to the fault type, and the operator must acknowledge and clear the fault before normal operation can resume.

### Implemented Faults

#### 🟠 Leak Bottle Fault

- Simulates a leaking bottle during the filling process.
- The bottle is allowed to continue through the production line.
- At the Combined Sorting and Reject Station, the bottle is identified as defective and rejected by the puller mechanism.
- A Leak Bottle alarm is displayed on the HMI.

---

#### 🔵 Cap Missing Fault

- Simulates a bottle leaving the capping station without a cap.
- Cap presence is verified at the Combined Sorting and Reject Station.
- Bottles with missing caps are rejected by the puller mechanism.
---

#### 🟡 Capping Arm Fault

Two fault modes are available for testing.

**1. Retract Jam**

- The capping arm successfully moves forward and applies the cap.
- The arm fails to return to its home position.
- The production cycle stops until the fault is cleared.

**2. Complete Jam**

- The capping arm cannot move forward.
- No cap is applied to the bottle.
- The production cycle stops immediately and an alarm is generated.

---

#### 🟣 Sorting Arm Fault

Two fault modes are available for testing.

**1. Retract Jam**

- The sorting arm successfully picks the bottle for rejection.
- The arm fails to return to its home position.
- The production cycle stops until the fault is cleared.

**2. Complete Jam**

- The sorting arm cannot move to pick the rejected bottle.
- The reject operation cannot be completed.
- The production cycle stops and an alarm is generated.

---

#### 🔴 Emergency Stop

- Immediately stops all machine operations.
- Conveyor, filling, capping, and sorting mechanisms are de-energized.
- The system remains in a safe state until the Emergency Stop is released and the operator restarts the machine.

> **Note:** All implemented faults can be manually simulated from the **Configuration Screen**, allowing operators and engineers to validate PLC logic, alarm handling, machine response, and fault recovery without introducing actual hardware failures.

## 🧠 PLC Program Architecture

The PLC program was developed using **RSLogix 500** for the **Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100 PLC**. To improve readability, simplify troubleshooting, and support future expansion, the application is organized into multiple modular ladder logic routines. Each routine is responsible for a specific machine function and is executed sequentially by the **Main Routine** during every PLC scan cycle.

### Program Structure

| Ladder File | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **LAD 2 – MAIN** | Performs system initialization, executes First Pass logic, resets machine data during startup, forces the machine into OFF mode, and calls all application subroutines every PLC scan. |
| **LAD 3 – I/O** | Maps all digital inputs and outputs, processes field signals, and updates actuator commands used throughout the program. |
| **LAD 4 – MODE CTRL** | Controls machine operating modes including OFF mode, Transit, Filling, Capping, Sorting, Cycle Reset, and machine state transitions. |
| **LAD 5 – SNS IN CTR** | Processes sensor inputs used for bottle detection, filling station positioning, capping station control, and sorting operations. |
| **LAD 6 – SIMULATION** | Simulates machine faults and operating conditions for testing, debugging, and HMI demonstration without requiring physical hardware failures. |
| **LAD 7 – DEVICE CTR** | Controls conveyors, filling valve, capping mechanism, sorting arm, reject puller, and other field devices. |
| **LAD 8 – CYCLE RST** | Handles machine cycle completion, production sequence reset, and prepares the system for processing the next bottle. |
| **LAD 9 – HOURMETER** | Calculates runtime, production statistics, bottle count, reject count, and bottles-per-hour. KPIs are updated every minute. |
| **LAD 10 – ALARMS** | Detects machine faults, manages alarms, controls alarm acknowledgement and reset, and communicates alarm information to the HMI. |

### Main Routine Responsibilities

- Executes First Pass initialization after the PLC enters RUN mode.
- Clears production data during startup.
- Places the machine into a safe OFF mode after initialization.
- Calls every functional subroutine during each PLC scan cycle.
- Maintains deterministic program execution by executing routines in a fixed sequence.

## 🎛️ HMI Design & Features

Many additional features and engineering considerations can be incorporated in real-world applications, including:

- Advanced machine safety systems
- Industrial communication networks (EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, Modbus TCP, OPC UA)
- Servo motion control and coordinated multi-axis systems
- Vision-based inspection and quality control
- Automatic recipe management for multiple bottle types
- SCADA and MES integration
- SQL database logging and production traceability
- Predictive and preventive maintenance
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) monitoring
- Energy monitoring and optimization
- Redundant control systems and fail-safe architectures
- Industrial cybersecurity and user access management

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the design methodology, modular PLC programming approach, HMI development, and industrial automation concepts that form the foundation of real manufacturing systems.
